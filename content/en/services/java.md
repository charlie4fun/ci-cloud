## Our Offer:
- "How would you rate your knowledge of <something> on a scale from 1 to 10?"
- "How many years of experience do you have with <something>?"
- "How many projects have you done with it?"

Those questions are hardly the best way to identify top specialists during screening.

With us, the screening is done by technical professionals — real Java Engineers.
This means you get specialists with proven knowledge, not just candidates who guessed the right keywords to pass automated filters.

## How we work (all steps below are free of charge):
1. Send us a description of the specialist you're looking for: abc@ci-cloud.de.
2. Within 1–2 business days, we’ll send you 2–3 CVs of suitable candidates.
3. If you're interested in one or more of the candidates, we’ll arrange an interview.
4. If you decide to move forward after the interview, we’ll sign a service agreement — and the specialist can get started right away.

## Payment terms:
1. You don’t pay anything for the candidate search or interviews — even if no one is hired.
2. The first payment is due after the first week of work, based on the number of hours the candidate has actually worked.
3. You can cancel the service agreement at any time within one week.
