## Why Choose Cloud Services?
Cloud services offer numerous advantages over on-premises solutions, making them a preferred choice for many businesses. Firstly, they provide scalability, allowing organizations to easily adjust their computing resources based on demand without the need for additional hardware investments. This scalability enables businesses to quickly adapt to changing needs and seize growth opportunities without being constrained by physical infrastructure limitations.

Secondly, cloud services offer enhanced flexibility and accessibility. With cloud computing, users can access data and applications from anywhere with an internet connection, facilitating remote work and collaboration. This flexibility empowers businesses to operate more efficiently and respond to market changes rapidly.

Moreover, cloud services often come with built-in redundancy and high availability features, minimizing the risk of downtime and data loss. Cloud providers typically offer robust security measures and compliance certifications, ensuring that data is protected and regulatory requirements are met.

## Front-end Development

The What addresses the things people can do with a product—its functionality. Finally, the How relates to the design of functionality in an accessible and aesthetically pleasant way. UX designers start with the Why before determining the What and then, finally, the How in order to create products that users can form meaningful experiences with. In software designs, you will need to ensure the product’s “substance” comes through an existing device and offers a seamless, fluid experience.

> As a UX designer, you should consider the Why, What and How of product use.

Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

## Design Systems

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized to aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites.

## Process

There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: the web designer and web developer, who often work closely together on a website. The web designers are responsible for the visual aspect, which includes the layout, coloring and typography of a web page.

- User experience research
- Visual design and illustration
- Programming and coding

Web designers will also have a working knowledge of markup languages such as HTML and CSS, although the extent of their knowledge will differ from one web designer to another.
