## General
We have done our best to create a simple, transparent privacy policy. **Our aim is to collect and store no data, or as little as possible.** We only use cookies that are essential to run this website.

This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, process, store, and protect any personal information you share with us while using our website (ci-cloud.de, hereinafter referred to as "website"), in full compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), the Telecommunication Digital Services Data Protection Act (TDDDG) and other applicable German data protection laws.

This site is statically generated and served as HTML. Fundamentally this means there is very little surface area for this site to be hacked or compromised. It does not require a database or backend server to process and render documents. Technically there is still a webserver, but it serves pre-rendered documents generated at build time.

### Definitions
Our privacy policy should be simple and easy to understand for everyone. In this data protection declaration, the official terms of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are generally used. The official definitions are explained in Art. 4 GDPR.

### Hosting
Our website is hosted by an external service provider, GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub, Inc. (GitHub B.V. Prins Bernhardplein 200, Amsterdam 1097JB The Netherlands and GitHub, Inc. 88 Colin P. Kelly Jr. St. San Francisco, CA 94107 United States), located in the United States. Hosting on GitHub Pages allows us to maintain a stable, secure, and optimized website for our users. While we manage the content displayed on our site, certain data collected through the website (such as IP addresses and browsing behavior) may be processed by GitHub as part of its hosting services.

**Data Processing by GitHub**

GitHub may collect and process certain technical data (e.g., IP addresses, log files) as part of their infrastructure services. This data may be automatically logged by GitHub to maintain and secure their network, optimize the hosting service, and fulfill legal obligations.

**Data Transfer to Third Countries**

As GitHub is based in the United States, personal data may be transferred to and processed in the United States. GitHub complies with GDPR through the implementation of adequate safeguards, including standard contractual clauses where applicable. For more information on GitHub’s data processing practices, please review GitHub’s [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

**Security Measures**

GitHub implements various technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of data on their servers. However, Cirro Cloud GmbH remains responsible for the management of website content and the protection of data shared through our site.

By using our website, you acknowledge that GitHub Pages processes data as part of their hosting services. For additional details about how GitHub Pages processes personal data, please refer directly to their [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

- **To Provide and Maintain the Site**: We use your personal data to provide you with access to our Site and to monitor and improve its performance.
- **To Send You Updates and Marketing Communications**: We may send you newsletters or marketing communications about our services.

- **With Service Providers**: We may share your information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf.

## Your Rights
The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example:
- **Access**: Request access to your personal data.
- **Correction**: Request correction of your personal data.
- **Deletion**: Request deletion of your personal data.
- **Data Portability**: Request the transfer of your personal data to another party.
- **Withdraw Consent**: Withdraw your consent at any time where we rely on your consent to process your personal data.

Your rights in detail:
- **Right to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR:** You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information on the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h GDPR.
- **Right to rectification pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR:** This right includes the rectification of inaccurate data and the completion of incomplete personal data.
- **Right to erasure in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR:** This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to request the erasure of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, if consent has been withdrawn or the initial processing took place without a legal basis. A detailed list of reasons can be found in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a to f GDPR. This “right to be forgotten” also corresponds to the controller's obligation under Art. 17 para. 2 GDPR to take reasonable measures to bring about the general erasure of data.
- **Right to restriction of processing pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR:** This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18 para. 1 lit. a to d.
- **Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR:** This regulates the basic right to receive your own data in a commonly used form and to transmit it to another controller. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract in accordance with Art. 20 (1) (a) and (b) and insofar as this is technically feasible.
- **Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR:** In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.
- **Right to “individual decision-making” pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR:** In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 (2) and (4) GDPR.
- **Further rights:** The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this is only possible or feasible with reasonable effort.</br>
At this point, we would like to draw your attention once again to your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 (3) GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.</br>
We would also like to draw your attention to your rights under Sections 32 et seq. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.
- **Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR:** You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates this regulation.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to help protect your personal data from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
